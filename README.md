# Udemy Scraper

A Python script to get instructor profiles and their course details from Udemy. It uses Selenium and `undetected-chromedriver` to grab data and saves it to a CSV file.

## Quick Start

1.  **Clone:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Michael58/udemy.git
    cd udemy
    ```

2.  **Set up (optional but good):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install stuff:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run it!**
    ```bash
    python udemy_scraper.py
    ```
    This will:
    *   Find instructor URLs (or use `urls.txt` if it's there).
    *   Get instructor and course info.
    *   Save to `udemy courses.csv`.

## Main Features

*   Gets instructor info (name, bio, photo, social links).
*   Gets course info (title, URL, lectures, reviews, rating, price).
*   Finds instructors from Udemy's sitemaps.
*   Tries to avoid being blocked by Udemy.
*   Can use multiple threads to run faster.
*   Saves instructor URLs to `urls.txt` so it doesn't have to find them every time.
*   Can pick up where it left off if you run it again (unless you use `--clean`).
*   Saves data to a CSV.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.7+
*   Google Chrome browser

## More Ways to Run

**More threads, different output file:**
```bash
python udemy_scraper.py --threads 5 --output my_udemy_data.csv
```

**Start fresh (ignores old `urls.txt` and output file):**
```bash
python udemy_scraper.py --clean
```

**Use a proxy:**
```bash
python udemy_scraper.py --proxies "http://user:pass@yourproxy.com:port"
```

## Command Line Options

*   `--output` / `-o`: Output CSV file name (default: `"udemy courses.csv"`)
*   `--threads` / `-t`: How many threads to use (default: `1`)
*   `--proxies` / `-p`: Proxy server (e.g., `"http://user:pass@host:port"`)
*   `--delay`: Wait time in seconds between some actions (default: `5.0`)
*   `--clean` / `-c`: Start fresh, ignore old files.
*   `--urls-file`: File for instructor URLs (default: `"urls.txt"`)
*   `--max-retries`: How many times to retry a failed URL (default: `5`)
*   `--headless`: Run browser without showing it (default is on).
*   `--browser-agent`: Custom browser ID string.

## How It Works

1.  Reads settings from command line or uses defaults.
2.  Finds instructor URLs (from `urls.txt` or Udemy sitemaps).
3.  For each instructor:
    *   Opens their page in a hidden Chrome browser.
    *   Grabs instructor details from the HTML.
    *   Clicks through all their course pages.
    *   Catches the course data sent by Udemy's server.
4.  Saves all data to a CSV file. If the script stopped, it tries to continue from where it left off next time.

## Output CSV Fields

-   `URL`: Instructor's profile URL.
-   `Name`: Instructor's name.
-   `What is (s)he an instructor in`: Instructor's title.
-   `Instructor_Photo_URL`: Profile picture URL.
-   `Description`: Instructor's bio.
-   `Total Learners`: Instructor's total students.
-   `Total Reviews`: Instructor's total reviews.
-   `Social Website`, `Social Youtube`, etc.: Social media links.
-   `Course Title`: Course name.
-   `Course URL`: Link to the course.
-   `Total number of lectures`: Lectures in the course.
-   `Total number of reviews`: Reviews for the course.
-   `Course Rating`: Course rating.
-   `Content Info`: Course length (e.g., "10.5 total hours").
-   `Course Price`: Course price.

## Notes

*   Websites change. If Udemy changes, this script might break.
*   Be nice to Udemy's servers. Don't use too many threads or too little delay.
